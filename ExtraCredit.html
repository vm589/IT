<h2> Do's and Don't when building a website </h2>
<p> There are many ways to build a website but for it to grab people' attention is another thing. Here are 5 general do's and don'ts when you start up building your website </p>

<h3> Things you should do </h3> 
<ul> 

<li> Always use "div" as its helpful as even though it does not have any visual effect on the website it helps organizing the code </li>
<li> The use of break or br is helpful especially since you cannot really know how a website will look when typing the paragaph out. <br> 
It will come down too the format of the website so using it helps keep it more in order to restart it on a new line </li>
<li> Using headers is very important as it helps give a title or introduction to the page. </li>
<li> Always remember to use "a" tags for whenever you want to provide an external link to another site for whatever reason </li>
<li> Linking images are more complicated so its important to memorize the steps. <br> The source file or src is placed at the start
and is where you put the image link, you then put alternative text and although it is optional
you could put the width and height and adjust it. </li>
</ul>

<h4> to avoid </h4>
<ul> 
<li> Not naming your headings in the right order. For example going from h1 to h4 </li>

<li> Confusing the title with a heading is another common mistake </li>

<li> Confusing li with ol in terms of listing </li>

<li> Trying to mix the css with the html. First finish the html coding to leave it less jarring to deal with </li>

<li> It is better to use an external css folder then incline </li>

<li> Overall just not having a clear image in mind, always have a clear goal so the website does not come out looking terrible. </li>
     
</ul>
